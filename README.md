# Tataplay API

This project is a Quart-based web service that integrates with external APIs to provide various functionalities, including channel redirection, license key provisioning, and M3U playlist generation.

## Features

- **Channel Redirection**: Redirects to the appropriate channel URL fetched from an external HMAC service.
- **License Key Provisioning**: Provides license keys in JSON format for a given TVG ID.
- **M3U Playlist Generation**: Generates an M3U playlist with links and metadata based on data from external services.

    ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Set Environment Variables**

    Set the `FQDN` environment variable to the Fully Qualified Domain Name where the application will be hosted. You can do this in your terminal or by adding it to your `.env` file:

    ```bash
    export FQDN='localhost:5000'
    ```

5. **Run the Application**
